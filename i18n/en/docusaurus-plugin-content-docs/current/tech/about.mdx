# What is an Originator Profile?

Originator Profile (OP) is a technology that allows content users to verify the authenticity and reliability of the sender of information (content) on the Internet.

By applying a digital signature to the information corresponding to the content and sender, it is possible to verify that the information has not been tampered with.

Information about the originator is handled in a data model called the Originator Profile (OP). The OP can include a certificate indicating that the originator is an information originator under the [Originator Profile (OP) Charter](https://originator-profile.org/ja-JP/charter/).

The certificate under the OP Charter covers the following:

- an information transmission policy
- Existence
- Eligibility for Industry/Business Type
  - Membership in industry associations
  - Certifications obtained

Content-related information is handled by a data model called Content Attestation (CA), which provides a mechanism to verify that the originator has the OP and that the content has not been tampered with.

OP and CA use a data model based on Verifiable Credentials (VCs). VCs follow the IHV model, which divides the roles of users of VCs into three parties: issuer, holder, and verifier. This model provides benefits such as protecting privacy and reducing server load during verification.
