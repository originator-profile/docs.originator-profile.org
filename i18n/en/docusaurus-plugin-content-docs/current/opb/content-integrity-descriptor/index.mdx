# Content Integrity Descriptor

Content Integrity Descriptor is a mechanism for ensuring the integrity of specific information within content. Various types of Content Integrity Descriptor can be defined. Each Content Integrity Descriptor has a method for identifying the location of the target information, a method for obtaining the information, and a method for verifying the integrity of that information. You can use different types depending on the information you want to ensure the integrity of, or define new ones.

## Registration Process

When creating a new Content Integrity Descriptor, you MUST define at least the following:

- Type name
- Property definitions
- The method to apply it to HTML
- Validation Process
- The method to identify element location

In addition, to avoid type name collisions, the defined Content Integrity Descriptor MUST be registered in the [Content Integrity Type Registry](#registry).

## Content Integrity Type Registry \{#registry}

- `HTMLTargetIntegrity`: [HTML Fragment Integrity](./html.md)
- `TextTargetIntegrity`: [Text within DOM Integrity](./text.md)
- `VisibleTextTargetIntegrity`: [Visible Text within DOM Integrity](./visible-text.md)
- `ExternalResourceTargetIntegrity`: [External Resource Integrity](./external-resource.md)
