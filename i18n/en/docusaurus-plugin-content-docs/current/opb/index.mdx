# Originator Profile Blueprint

_This document is non-normative._

Aiming to document the technical specifications of the Originator Profile (OP)

These documents on this site describe the technical aspects of Originator Profile.
Originator Profile technology does not provide a value judgment of the correctness, falsity, or inaccuracy of any particular piece of content, but aims to provide a cryptographically verifiable means by which anyone can assess its trustworthiness.

## Overview of Originator Profile

![](./assets/spec-overview.svg)

The OP specification defines Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and how it is distributed.
Definitions of terms common throughout this specification are provided in the [Terminology](./terminology.md).

The OP defines the following specifications as common specifications for VCs.

- [OP VC Data Model](./op-vc-data-model.md): VC-compliant data model defined in OP
- [Securing Mechanism](./securing-mechanism.md): Securing Mechanism of VCs as defined in OP

This document defines a data model for VCs to indicate keys that can verify an organization is the originator.

- [Core Profile (CP)](./cp.md)

This document defines a data model for VCs to assert additional information about the originator, where that information has been validated by an appropriate entity.

- [Profile Annotation (PA)](./pa.md)

The following documents define a data model for PA corresponding to various use cases.

- [Certificate Data Model](./certificate.md): The Certificate PA Data Model
  - [Organization Existence Certificate](./pa-model/existence.md): Data model for organization existence certificate.
  - [Advertising Certification Certificate](./pa-model/advertising-certification.md): Data model for advertising certification certificate.
  - [News Media Registration Certificate](./pa-model/news-media-registration.md): Data model for news media registration certificate.
  - [Municipality Certification Certificate](./pa-model/municipality-certificate.md): Data model for municipality certification certificate.

This document defines a data model for VCs to indicate the content originated by the originator.

- [Content Attestation (CA)](./ca.md)

The following documents define a data model for CA corresponding to various use cases.

- [Article Data Model](./ca-model/article.md): CA data model linked to articles on the Internet.
- [Online Ad Data Model](./ca-model/online-ad.md): CA data model linked to Online advertising.
- [Advertorial](./ca-model/advertorial.md): CA data model linked to advertorials on the Internet.

Furthermore, the following documents define the specification for the Content Integrity Descriptor, which is a mechanism to prevent tampering with the content indicated by the CA.

- [Content Integrity Type Registry](./content-integrity-descriptor/index.mdx): Registry server for Content Integrity Descriptor
- [HTML Target](./content-integrity-descriptor/html.md): Verifies the integrity of the target DOM element as an HTML string.
- [Text Target](./content-integrity-descriptor/text.md): Verifies the integrity of the text content of the target DOM element
- [Visible Text Target](./content-integrity-descriptor/visible-text.md): Verifies the integrity of the rendered text of the target element
- [External Resource Target](./content-integrity-descriptor/external-resource.md): Verifies the integrity of external resources.

This document defines a data model for VCs to assert the name and other identifiers that the originator claims as a web publisher.

- [Web Media Profile (WMP)](./web-media-profile.md)

This document defines a data model for VCs to indicate the website operated by the originator.

- [Web Site Profile (WSP)](./website-profile.md)

The following data formats are defined for the collective distribution of the VCs as defined by the OP.

- [Originator Profile Set（OPS)](./originator-profile-set.md): OPS is a distribution format for CP, PA, and WMP.
- [Content Attestation Set(CAS)](./content-attestation-set.md): CAS is the distribution format of CA.
- [Site Profile(SP)](./site-profile.md): SP is the distribution format of WSP
- [Linking](./link-to-html.md): This is how to link CAS and OPS to HTML pages.

The OP defines the following as organization IDs and uses them in each VC:

- [Originator Profile Identifier (OP ID)](./op-id.md): Organization IDs
- [DNS URI OP ID](./dns-uri-op-id.md): OP ID using a domain name

The JSON-LD context used throughout VCs is documented in the following document:

- [JSON-LD Context](./context.md)

The following documents ensure the security of the entire OP framework.

- [Cryptographic algorithm](./algorithm.md): The cryptographic algorithm recommended by the OP
