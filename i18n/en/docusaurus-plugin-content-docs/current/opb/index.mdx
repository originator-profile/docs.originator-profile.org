Aiming to document the technical specifications of the Originator Profile

These documents on this site describe the technical aspects of Originator Profile.
Originator Profile technology does not provide a value judgment of the correctness, falsity, or inaccuracy of any particular piece of content, but aims to provide a cryptographically verifiable means by which anyone can assess its trustworthiness.

## Overview of Originator Profile

![](./assets/spec-overview.svg)

The OP specification defines a Verifiable Credential (VC) and how it is distributed.
Definitions of terms common throughout this specification are provided in the [Glossary](./terminology.md).

The OP defines the following specifications as common specifications for VC.

- [OP VC Data Model](./op-vc-data-model.md): VC-compliant data model defined in OP
- [Securing Mechanism](./securing-mechanism.md): Securing Mechanism of VC as defined in OP

The OP defines the following as organization IDs and uses them in each VC:

- [OP ID](./op-id.md): OP ID
- [DNS URI OP ID](./dns-uri-op-id.md): OP ID using a domain name

The following documents define the data models for the three VCs that play a central role in OP:

- [Core Profile(CP)](./cp.md): CP consists of an organization's OP ID and a VC of its public key.
- [Profile Annotation(PA)](./pa.md): PA may include proof of the sender's entity identity, information about certificates granted by various certification authorities, and membership certificates from various organizations, each signed by the appropriate entity.
- [Content Attestation(CA)](./ca.md): CA contains information about the Web Content created and managed by the CP holder, as well as information about the target content and verification methods, and is signed by the CP holder.

In addition to these, the following VCs are defined:

- [Web Media Profile(WMP)](./web-media-profile.md): WMP is a VC that describes the information to be displayed to users when using the OP on the Web (such as the sender's policy statement, contact information, etc.) and is signed by the CP holder.
- [Web Site Profile(WSP)](./website-profile.md): WSP is a VC that indicates that the sender owns a website. It is signed by the CP holder.

[Profile Annotation(PA)](./pa.md), [Content Attestation](./ca.md) When actually using PA and CA, it is necessary to define specific properties according to the application.
The property definitions used in OP CIP are defined in the following implementer's guide:

- Content Attestation
  - [Article Data Model](./ca-guide/article.md): CA data model linked to articles on the Internet.
  - [Online Ad Data Model](./ca-guide/online-ad.md): CA data model linked to Online advertising.
- Profile Annotation
  - [Certificate Data Model](./certificate.md): The Certificate PA Data Model
    - [Organization Existence Certificate](./pa-guide/existence.md): Data model for organization existence certificate.
    - [Advertising Certification Certificate](./pa-guide/advertising-certification.md): Data model for advertising certification certificate.
    - [News Media Registration Certificate](./pa-guide/news-media-registration.md): Data model for news media registration certificate.
    - [Municipality Certification Certificate](./pa-guide/municipality-certificate.md): Data model for municipality certification certificate.

The following data formats are defined for distributing these VCs together.

- [Content Attestation Set(CAS)](./content-attestation-set.md): CAS is the distribution format of CA.
- [Originator Profile Set（OPS)](./originator-profile-set.md): OPS is a distribution format for CP, PA, and WMP.
- [Site Profile(SP)](./site-profile.md): SP is the distribution format of WSP
- [Linking](./link-to-html.md): This is how to link CAS and OPS to HTML pages.

CA has a mechanism to prevent content tampering called Target Integrity. The following implementation guide is the specification for it.

- [Target Integrity Registry](./target-guide/index.mdx): Registry server for Target Integrity
- [HTML Target](./target-guide/html.md): Verifies the integrity of the target DOM element as an HTML string.
- [Text Target](./target-guide/text.md): Verifies the integrity of the text content of the target DOM element
- [Visible Text Target](./target-guide/visible-text.md): Verifies the integrity of the rendered text of the target element
- [External Resource Target](./target-guide/external-resource.md): Verifies the integrity of external resources.

The following documents ensure the security of the entire OP framework.

- [Cryptographic algorithm](./algorithm.md): The cryptographic algorithm recommended by the OP

The JSON-LD context used throughout VC is documented in the following document:

- [JSON-LD Context](./context.md)

The following documents are under construction.

- [`did:op` DID Method](./other/did-op.md): `did:op` OP ID using DID Method
- [`did:2` DID Method](./other/did-2.md): `did:2` OP ID using DID Method
- [Trust Model](./other/trust-model.md): A mechanism to ensure the reliability of VCs
- [Certificate Category](./other/category.md): A document on the categories that determine the order in which certificates are displayed.
