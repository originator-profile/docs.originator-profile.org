# PA Data Models

These are the data models of [Profile Annotation](../pa.md) (PA). This defines the VC specification based on [Profile Annotation](../pa.md) for applications developed by the Originator Profile Collaborative Innovation Partnership (OP-CIP).

import DocCardList from "@theme/DocCardList";

<DocCardList />

## Registration Process

When creating a new type of Profile Annotation, you MUST define at least the following:

- Type name
- Property definitions

In addition, to avoid type name collisions, the defined Profile Annotation MUST be registered in the [Profile Annotation Type Registry](#registry).

## Profile Annotation Type Registry {#registry}
