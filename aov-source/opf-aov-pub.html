        This document provides an architectural overview of the Originator
        Profile Framework (OPF), a framework designed to provide rich
        information about the origin of the information (Originator Profile
        &mdash; OP), with content provenance originating from the origin in
        digital media and advertising ecosystems. This document introduces the
        key concepts, data models, operational processes, and governance model
        that enable verifiable profiles for content originators, supported by
        third-party-validated originator attributes as part of Originator
        Profile. The overview also includes comparisons to other similar
        projects, current use cases, and distilled requirements. This document
        is primarily intended for technical audiences and technically
        knowledgeable end-users to understand the design of the Originator
        Profile Framework.

      <h2>Status of this Document</h2>
      <p>
        This document is a description of the current design of the Originator
        Profile Framework (OPF) developed by the Originator Profile
        Collaborative Innovation Partnership (OP-CIP). It is in DRAFT status,
        which means it has no official standing of any kind and does not
        represent the consensus of the OP-CIP Membership.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        These days, we need to judge whether the information we receive is
        legitimate or not. False information and misinformation spread,
        primarily through fraudulent websites mimicking legitimate
        organizations. In the advertisement ecosystem, media inadvertently
        display fraudulent advertisements on their websites, causing damage to
        their reputation through association with these ads. On the contrary,
        advertisers unknowingly display their advertisements on fraudulent
        websites, which causes damage to their brand reputation through
        association with fraudulent sites. Thus, the situation is causing not
        only harm to the readers but also affecting all of the stakeholders.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then, what do the well-behaved stakeholders in the ecosystem expect?
        From the reader's perspective, the media that provides information is
        the kind of information the reader is expecting, and the information
        provided by the media is expected to be reasonably reliable. At the
        very least, the media must deliver information to the readers
        accurately, as intended. The user must be able to verify the origin of
        the information and also understand the origin's nature. Of course,
        there are differing viewpoints on the accuracy of the information's
        delivery; still, it should be delivered in a manner intended by the
        media &mdash; accurately and in a timely manner. From the media's
        perspective, they will expect that information is delivered accurately
        to readers. They will also expect that appropriate advertisements are
        displayed on their websites. Advertisers will expect that their
        advertisements are displayed on appropriate media.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originator Profile Framework is a set of technology and operational
        guidelines primarily designed for web media and digital advertisement
        use cases to answer these expectations. In technical terms, the
        Originator Profile Framework provides content provenance, alongside
        verifiable profile information that is the origin of the content, the
        Originator Profile. The profile information is validated and provided
        by multiple third parties, composed into an Originator Profile. (Note
        that operational guidelines are still being developed and will be
        provided in the future.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The document you are reading is one of the documents in the Originator
        Profile Framework documentation series. Currently, the following two
        sets of documents are being prepared:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Originator Profile Framework &mdash; Architecture Overview</b>
            (this document) provides an introductory overview of the
            Originator Profile Framework, including a discussion of what the
            framework aims to address, high-level concepts of the framework,
            and the framework at multiple levels of abstraction. It also
            includes a brief description of the use cases and requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Originator Profile Blueprints (OPB)</b> are a series of
            topic-specific documents describing various aspects of the
            Originator Profile, not only the technology side, but also
            including governance and operations. OPBs are available on the
            [[Originator Profile Blueprints]] website. These documents will be
            ultimately combined into the following four documents. Currently,
            most of the OPBs are focusing on the technical implementation
            &mdash; specifically, how to implement. We describe the reason
            behind the design in this document.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The following four documents will be compiled in the future based on
        the above two documents &mdash; some parts of this document may be
        moved into these four documents, too:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Originator Profile Framework &mdash; Architecture Overview</b>
            will be part of the documentation for the Originator Profile
            Framework, providing a high-level view of its components and
            interactions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Originator Profile Framework &mdash; Core Specification</b>
            describes the shared part of the Originator Profile Framework,
            apart from specifics to the use cases.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Originator Profile Framework &mdash; Design and Implementation
              for Web Media</b>
            describes the data model, processes, high-level governance model,
            and specification for the Web Media use case.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Originator Profile Framework &mdash; Design and Implementation
              for Web Advertisement</b>
            describes the data model, processes, high-level governance model,
            and specification for the Web Advertisement use case.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="note">
        The Originator Profile Blueprints are currently living documents
        matching the corresponding implementations. Since the OPBs are living
        documents, this document refers to OPBs for implementation details and
        relies on their descriptions. In such cases, we provide references to
        the corresponding OPBs as necessary. The Originator Profile Blueprints
        may remain after the publication of the above documents to host the
        future improvement proposals and discussions.
        <br/>
        <strong>Note on the current primary language: </strong>
        The current primary language for the Originator Profile Blueprints is
        Japanese, and English translations are done with AI-assisted human
        work. Due to that, there are some potential inconsistencies between
        the Japanese and English versions. Both versions are available at the
        [[Originator Profile Blueprints]] website.

      <h1>Architecture of the Originator Profile Framework</h1>
      <p>
        The architecture of the [=Originator Profile Framework=] is designed
        to support a wide range of use cases and applications. It is a modular
        framework that allows for easy integration with existing systems and
        services.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the following sections, we introduce high-level concepts and
        components of the [=Originator Profile Framework=].
      </p>

      <section id="what-op-provides">
        <h2>A Simple Picture: What Originator Profile Provides</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="#fig-what-op-provides"></a> illustrates the capabilities of
          the [=Originator Profile Framework=] in a simple picture.

            alt="What Originator Profile Provides" width="70%"/>
          <figcaption>What Originator Profile provides</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Firstly, [=Originator Profile Framework=] provides rich information
          about the [=Originator=] &mdash; [=Originator Profile=] &mdash;
          which the name comes from (①). It includes not only the basic
          attributes about the organization but also various attributes
          validated by multiple third parties that are useful for the
          [=Recipient=] to assess the [=Content=].
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, [=Originator Profile Framework=] provides a way to provide
          integrity verification of the [=Content=] and also the origin of the
          [=Content=] as an [=Originator Profile=] (②).
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, the [=Recipient=] of the [=Content=] can verify the integrity and
          authenticity of the [=Content=] using the information provided, and also
          refer to the [=Originator Profile=] to know about the attributes of the
          [=Originator=] (③).
        </p>
        <p>
          The framework is designed to be extensible and adaptable to various
          use cases; for the [=Originator Profile=], it allows adding
          [=Validated Attributes=] provided by multiple parties. For
          [=Content=] integrity, the framework is extensible to accept
          different types of media in different types of serialization. For
          example, the Web Media specific models allow for the protection of
          text fragments and other media within a web page.

        <h2>Abstract Model: Signed Data with Policy</h2>
        <p>
          In this document, we define [=Signed Data=] and [=Signed Data with
          Policy=] based on "Cryptographically Signed Data" as discussed in
          detail in the paper [[A Model For Claim Validation]]. We define [=Core
          Profile=] and [=Profile Annotation=] based on the "Certificate" concepts
          presented in the same paper. In the following sections, we will
          elaborate on definitions and their implications.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          The terminology used in the paper [[A Model For Claim Validation]],
          "verify" and "validate," in particular, is different from the
          terminology used in this document. In the paper, the author dictates
          that the difference between these two acts is a lack of context in
          validation. In this document, we use "verify" to mean the act of
          checking the integrity of [=Signed Data=] using the [=Verification
          Key=], and "validate" to mean the act of assessing the truthfulness
          of a piece of information by directly checking the [=Entity=] itself
          or consulting highly reliable sources, such as government databases.
          This distinction is essential in the context of [=Originator Profile
          Framework=], as it helps clarify the roles and responsibilities of
          different [=Entities=] involved in the ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          There are interesting but very confusing aspects in the difference
          between "verify" and "validate" within Japan. It is regrettable that
          these two words are often translated into the same Japanese word
          「検証」 (pronounced as 'ken-sho') and are used interchangeably,
          leading to misunderstandings in this digital signature application
          area. Thus, i.e., AI translation of this document can not reflect
          the nuances of "verify" and "validate" as outlined in this document.

          <h3>Signed Data</h3>
          <p>
            In [[A Model For Claim Validation]], "Cryptographically Signed Data" is a conceptual
            model in which an originator signs a payload and bundles three
            elements: (1) a verification key (or a reference to it), (2) the
            payload (the subject being attested), and (3) the digital
            signature over that key and payload. This structure lets a
            recipient check source authenticity and payload integrity using
            the corresponding verification key. 
          </p>
          <figure id="fig-signed-data">
            <img src="Drawings/Architecture-Signed-Data.drawio.svg"
              alt="Signed Data" width="70%"/>
            <figcaption>Signed Data</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Crucially, "Cryptographically Signed Data" alone does not
            establish the truth of any claim encoded in the payload; it only
            confirms the authenticity of the source and the integrity of the
            data. Determining whether a claim is valid requires additional
            evidence and a validator-specific validation policy (i.e.,
            criteria/intent), which is distinct from mere cryptographic
            verification. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In this document,
            A [=Signed Data=] consists of three elements &mdash; [=Verification
            Key=] or reference to it, payload, and signature &mdash; and provides a
            way to verify that the signature is created on the payload, with
            the [=Signing Key=] that is bound to the [=Verification Key=],
            Thus the integrity of the payload is ensured, and use the
            [=Verification Key=] to identify the [=Entity=] which signed the data.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Signed Data with Policy</h3>
          <p>
            In [=Originator Profile Framework=], all of the data models are
            based on [=Signed Data=] under a specific policy. We refer to this
            as [=Signed Data with Policy=]. A [=Signed Data with Policy=] can
            provide a way to express the intent and context of a signature
            based on predefined and shared policies. [=Signed Data with
            Policy=] is an abstract concept of digital credentials (i.e.,
            [[vc-data-model-2.0]]) and/or digital certificates (i.e.,
            [[X509V3]]).
          </p>
          <figure id="fig-signed-data-with-policy">
            <img src="Drawings/Architecture-Signed-Data-with-Policy.drawio.svg"
              alt="Signed Data with Policy" width="70%"/>
            <figcaption>Signed Data with Policy</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            In [[A Model For Claim Validation]], the authors detailed the
            relationship between signed data with policy and the related
            processes. A "Certificate" is a form of signed data issued by a
            certifier that (i) asserts the certifier has validated a specific
            claim and (ii) attests that validation according to the
            certifier’s certification policy (its criteria). Concretely, it
            bundles three elements &mdash; (1) the certifier’s verification
            key (or a reference), (2) a payload stating what has been
            certified, and (3) the certifier’s digital signature over that key
            and payload. Its signature intends to show not just who issued
            it, but that the issuer certifies the claim according to its
            policy; validators can then accept the claim by verifying the
            certificate and trusting the certifier under their own validation
            policy. 
            <p class="note">
              We avoid using the term "Certificate" or "Credentials" to
              describe the signed data within the [=Originator Profile
              Framework=]. The term "Certificate" in digital contexts
              typically refers to a public key certificate (i.e., [[X509V3]]),
              and the term "Credentials" often implies a broader set of claims
              or attributes. But in a non-digital world, many of the concepts
              around certification and credentials are more fluid and
              context-dependent. The confusion is particularly true in
              relation to the specific non-digital activities regarding
              "certification." Thus, using these terms could lead to
              misunderstandings about the nature and scope of the signed data
              being discussed here.

        <h2>Limitations of X.509 PKI to Implement Originator Profile Framework</h2>
        <p>
          When using a digital signing scheme, there is a need to find
          the [=Verification Key=] of the signer and ensure that the
          corresponding [=Signing Key=] belongs to the correct [=Entity=]. To
          implement this, we typically rely on X.509 [[X509V3]] public key
          certificate scheme, which is widely used in various applications,
          and well understood. However, to implement the [=Originator Profile
          Framework=], the current design of X.509 lacks flexibility. This
          section discusses the limitations we want to address.

          <p class="note">
            While we discuss the limitations of X.509 here, and the current
            Originator Profile implementation does not yet support all aspects
            of it, it is still possible to leverage X.509 technology and its
            ecosystem within the [=Originator Profile Framework=] to achieve certain
            goals with limitations. Please refer to <a
            href="#known-issues-and-future-changes"></a> for more details.
          </p>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Flexible addition of Attributes is difficult</strong>
            <p>
              With X.509 certificates, it is challenging to add attributes
              required for specific application purposes freely. Even it is
              possible to add some attributes, the certificate issuer must
              validate all attributes included in the certificate.
              Furthermore, since X.509 certificates are expressed as a single
              certificate, it is not possible to split the certificate for
              representation or combine certificates from different issuers.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li><strong>Difficult to introduce an amended issuance policy</strong>
            <p>
              While related to the discussion on adding attribute information,
              certificate issuance policies are generally stringent and offer
              no flexibility. There are use cases where specific communities
              operate specialized sets of public key certificates for
              particular purposes, signaling that the public key used for
              signing satisfies specific policy requirements. To implement
              this type of "virtual list of certificates," it may be necessary
              to establish an entire certificate tree, including the operation
              of a Certificate Authority (CA). Since operating such a CA
              involves significant work and complexity, it is often not
              feasible for smaller communities or specialized use cases.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li><strong>Satisfying certificate status checking scalability
                        requirement is challenging</strong>
            <p>
              Public key certificates require periodic or on-demand validity
              checks. Protocols like [[OCSP]] and CRL [[RFC5280]] are
              currently in use. However, even within the scope of public key
              certificates used by web servers, OCSP fails to meet scalability
              requirements, and CRLs pose privacy concerns. There are some
              discussions on improvement, but there are no reasonable
              solutions yet as discussed in a paper [[SoK-DR]]. These factors
              contribute to the trend toward shorter certificate lifetimes.
              Furthermore, in the domain targeted by [=Originator Profile
              Framework=], considering that a much larger number of
              [=Entities=] will generate significantly more signed data, which
              a vastly greater number of clients will verify, the scale
              involved is expected to be orders of magnitude larger.
              Therefore, a new approach that does not rely on current
              mechanisms is necessary.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        In [=Originator Profile Framework=], these
        limitations are addressed by a more flexible and extensible framework.

        <h2>Architectural Design of Originator Profile Framework</h2>
        <p>
          While [=Originator Profile Framework=] aims to provide content
          provenance, it addresses the limitations of current digital
          public key certificate schemes by providing a more flexible and
          extensible framework to provide validated attributes. All of the
          signed data are [=Signed Data from Originator=], that is a kind of
          [=Signed Data with Policy=]; thus, it is signed with intent under the
          corresponding policy of the [=Originator=].
        </p>
        <p>
          The [=Originator Profile Framework=] architecture currently
          comprises three groups of models: the [=Base Model=], a domain-agnostic
          model; the [=Jurisdiction Specific Model=], which extends the [=Base
          Model=] to support specific jurisdictions; and the [=Web Media
          Specific Model=], a model that extends the [=Base Model=] for Web
          Media. We expect to introduce a similar supplemental model in each
          of the future application domains. Each of the models is detailed in
          its respective section: <a href="#base-model"></a>,
          <a href="#jurisdiction-specific-model"></a>, and <a
          href="#web-media-specific-model"></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the following subsections, we will delve into some details of
          three key models: the [=Originator Profile=], [=Signed Data from
          Originator=], and [=Content Attestation=]. The details of these
          models are described in <a href="#base-model"></a>.

          <h3>Originator Profile</h3>
          <p>
            In the [=Originator Profile Framework=], the information about
            the [=Originator=] that is to be verifiable is a [=Signed Data from
            Originator=]; the Originator issues the signed data under a specific
            policy. The Originator's information is expressed as an [=Originator
            Profile=]. An [=Originator Profile=] consists of a [=Core
            Profile=], which contains the [=Originator=]'s [=Verification
            Key=], and one or more [=Profile Annotations=] that attach
            [=Validated Attributes=] to the [=Core Profile=].

            The [=Core Profile=] includes the [=Originator=]'s [=Verification

            described in the following section. [=Core Profile=] contains
            essential attributes of [=Originator Profile=]. [=Core Profile
            Issuers=] issues it under [=Core Profile Policy=].
          </p>
          <p>
            The [=Profile Annotation=] is a set of additional attributes that
            are issued by [=Profile Annotation Issuers=] independently of the
            [=Core Profile Issuer=]. [=Profile Annotation=] is also based on
            [=Signed Data from Originator=]. A [=Core Profile=] may be bound

            [=Profile Annotation Issuers=], as specified in the [=Profile

            concept, and various specialized types of [=Profile Annotations=]
            exist; this is one of the extension points for each application
            domain.

            part of the [=Originator Profile=]. The [=Recipient=] can verify
            the integrity of the [=Content=] alongside the [=Originator

            On the issuance of [=Core Profile=], the [=Core Profile Issuer=]
            [=Validates=] the identity and [=Attributes=] of the

            The [=Core Profile Issuer=] must maintain a record of all issued

          <p>
            The policy is similar to that of X. 509-based Certificate
            Authority (CA) policies, and a lot can be learn from the
            experiences of the ecosystem. However, due to the decomposed
            nature of the [=Core Profile=] and [=Profile Annotations=],
            additional considerations may be necessary to address the unique
            aspects of each component.

          <p>
            OP-CIP is currently developing initial [=Core Profile Policy=] for
            initial deployment alongside with other policies.
            <p class="note">
              Currently, issuance of an [=Originator Profile=], the OP-CIP

            The details of the policy depend on the specific use cases and

        This section discusses [=Jurisdiction Specific Model=].
        Jurisdiction-specific models address the distinct needs of various

        aspects of each jurisdiction's entity model differences, such as, but
        not limited to, differences in definitions of legal entities.
        Jurisdiction-specific models may define additional attributes or
        validation mechanisms that are specific to a particular jurisdiction.

      <p>
        While we design the [=Originator Profile Framework=] for global
        deployment, we are currently focusing on the requirements specific to
        Japan as we initially deploy the framework within Japan. However, we

          While we recognize that an abstract data model is necessary to

          <h3>Data Model for Japanese Organizations</h3>
          <p>
            In Japan, the validation of an organization's existence typically
            involves verifying the organization's registration status with the
            relevant government authorities. Such validation may include
            verifying the organization's registration number, tax
            identification number, and other official documentation (note:
            registration number and tax identification number are different).
            Additionally, organizations will be required to provide proof of
            their physical presence in Japan, such as a local business address
            and contact information.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, once the company registration number is
            validated and provided in verifiable manner, it can provide a way
            to retrieve detailed information from the relevant government
            authorities relying on the registration number.

        Profile Framework=] to provide a flexible governance model that
        accommodates various use cases and stakeholder requirements; In other
        words, [=Originator Profile Framework=] is designed to support the
        diverse needs of various stakeholders involved in the content
        ecosystem and beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the framework, [=Originator=]'s identity &mdash; including
        [=Verification Key=] and [=Validated Attributes=] &mdash; is unbundled
        into [=Core Profile=] and multiple [=Profile Annotations=], to allow
        later flexible composition. Each of the [=Validated Attributes=] may
        be bound to specific policies. These policies and the issuance
        operation are governed by the governance body appropriately.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the following sections, we first introduce a generic governance
        model, then show the X.509 PKI-based system as an example of the
        governance model. Then, we provide examples of governance models for
        various use cases, including the minimal governance model for
        the [=Originator Profile Framework=] planned in Japan. We extend the
        discussion to governance models for other jurisdictions and, finally,
        for the global community. Each of the extensions requires increasing
        stakeholder involvement to govern the system effectively.

        <h2>A Generic Governance Model</h2>
        <p>
          The figure below shows a highly simplified generic governance model
          distilled from the discussion in the [[Trusted Web White Paper
          3.0]]. (Note: the governance model discussed in the white paper is
          based on the discussion by one of the authors, in the paper [[A
          Study on Governance funded by JFSA]], which includes an analysis of
          [[ICANN]] multistakeholder model)

        </figure>
        <p>
          The governance in the digital ecosystem usually revolves around
          "Data Under Governance." The "Governing Body" is controlling the
          "Operator." The "Operator" manages the "Data Under Governance." The
          "Operator" is responsible for overseeing the management and
          protection of this data under the "Policy," which includes
          operational policy. The "Operator" operates under the policy
          faithfully, and the "Governance Body" is able to control "Data Under
          Governance" through the "Policy."

        <h2>X.509 PKI based system with the Generic Governance Model</h2>
        <p>
          Following is an simplified representation of the governance model
          for an X.509 PKI system, based on the Generic model discussed in the
          previous section.
        </p>
        <figure id="x509-goverance-example">
          <img src="Drawings/Governance-Simplified-X509.drawio.svg"
            alt="Example of Governance of X.509 PKI" width="70%">
          <figcaption>Simplified Governance model of X.509 PKI</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          This figure presents a simplified governance structure of the X.509
          Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) system. At the top of the hierarchy
          is the governing body, which establishes the overarching policies
          and trust framework for the PKI ecosystem. The Trust List, alongside
          with the governing body are the root of trust of the community which
          shared the same root of trust.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the governing body, Certificate Authorities (CAs) are
          responsible for issuing and managing digital certificates in
          accordance with these policies. The CAs act as trusted third
          parties, validating the identities of entities requesting
          certificates and ensuring compliance with governance requirements.
          Relying parties, such as users, applications, or organizations,
          depend on the trustworthiness of the CAs and the integrity of the
          certificates they issue to authenticate identities and secure
          communications. The figure illustrates the flow of trust, policy
          enforcement, and operational responsibilities among these entities,
          clarifying how governance is maintained and how trust is propagated
          within the X.509 PKI environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The verifying entity in the figure refers to the "Trust List" via
          the operating system or application, which includes the list of
          trusted root CAs. The operating system or application vendor
          typically manages the trust list, and it is updated through a
          software update mechanism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, from the verifying entity's perspective, which occurs through
          the operating library or application, the trust list is usually
          invisible; therefore, the operating system or application
          automatically trusts the root CAs in the trust list. Also, since the
          governing mechanism is hardbound to the entire trust tree, the only
          policy it can refer to and rely on is the policies defined by the
          governing bodies, which are maintaining the trust list, and each of
          the CAs.

        <h2>Governance model for Web Media while in the bootstrap phase in Japan</h2>
        <p>
          The following is a simplified representation of the Originator
          Profile Governance Model planned for Japanese Media, within Japan,
          during the Bootstrap phase.
        </p>
        <figure id="governance-bootstrap-phase-japan">
          <img src="Drawings/Governance-Simplified-OP-Current-Japan.drawio.svg"
            alt="Governance model of Originator Profile for the bootstrap phase in Japan (Planned)" width="75%"/>
          <figcaption>Governance model of Originator Profile for the bootstrap
          phase in Japan (Planned)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Firstly, in the Web Media ecosystem,  [=Originator Profile=] is
          composed of four sets of [=Validated Attributes=] &mdash; [=Core
          Profile=], [=Organization Profile=], [=Web Media Profile=], and
          potentially, at least one "Media Association's Membership."
        </p>
        <p>
          For the bootstrap phase in Japan, [=Core Profile=], [=Organization
          Profile=], and [=Web Media Profile=] are issued by the OP-CIP.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the "Media Association's Membership," we plan to have it issued
          by one of the media associations in Japan. The actual issuance of a
          "Media Association's Membership" is potentially operated by OP-CIP
          on behalf of the media association, while the media association
          controls and is responsible for the validation of the membership.
        </p>
        <p>
          The [=Originator=] (Media) requests the [=Core Profile=] and [=Web
          Media Profile=] from OP-CIP by providing the necessary information
          to satisfy the [=Core Profile Policy=] and [=Web Media Specific
          Policy=]. OP-CIP validates the information and issues the profiles
          to the [=Originator=]. OP-CIP also issues the [=Organization
          Profile=] by validating the organization's existence in Japan.
        </p>
        <p>
          The [=Recipient=] will verify the [=Originator Profile=] of the
          [=Originator=] by referring to the [=Verification Key=] included in
          the [=Core Profile=] of the OP-CIP. Then, the [=Recipient=] verifies
          the [=Content Attestation=] using the [=Verification Key=] in the
          [=Core Profile=] of the [=Originator=].
        </p>
        <p>
          The current implementation of the browser extension embeds the
          [=Verification Key=] of OP-CIP within the extension itself. Thus,
          the extension can verify the [=Originator Profile=] issued by OP-CIP
          without referring to any external trust list. Current implementation
          merely embeds and refers to the [=Verification Key=] of OP-CIP.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the figures in the following sections, for brevity, we only show
          the issuing part of the governance models, which is marked "(A)" in
          <a href="#governance-bootstrap-phase-japan"></a>.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
          Currently, issuance of an [=Originator Profile=], the OP-CIP
          mandates that the [=Originator=]'s commitment to the [[The
          Originator Profile Charter]]. This requirement is to ensure that
          all [=Originators=] adhere to a standard set of principles and
          practices, thereby fostering trust and reliability within the
          ecosystem. However, it is essential to note that this
          requirement is specific to the initial deployment phase and may
          be subject to change in the future as the ecosystem evolves and
          matures.

        <h2>Governance Model for other Jurisdictions</h2>
        <p>
          The following is a simplified representation of the Originator
          Profile Governance Model, which is planned for use in other
          jurisdictions.
        </p>
        <figure id="planned-op-goverance-1">
          <img src="Drawings/Governance-Simplified-OP-Future-Other-Jurisdictions.drawio.svg"
            alt="Governance Model for other jurisdictions (Planned)" width="75%"/>
          <figcaption>Governance Model for other jurisdictions (Planned)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          In this model, the [=Core Profile=] and [=Organization Profile=] are
          issued by OP-CIP, similar to the model for Japan. However, the
          [=Organization Profile=] (localized for jurisdiction XX) is issued
          by an [=Originator Profile Issuer=] in jurisdiction XX, which OP-CIP
          recognizes. The local [=Originator Profile Issuer=] is responsible
          for validating the attributes specific to the organization's
          existence in that jurisdiction, ensuring compliance with local
          regulations and standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          We need to establish a mechanism to recognize the local [=Originator
          Profile Issuer=] by OP-CIP. This may involve a formal recognition
          process, where OP-CIP evaluates the local issuer's policies,
          procedures, and trustworthiness before granting them the authority
          to issue [=Organization Profiles=] localized for the jurisdiction.
          OP-CIP may issue a special kind of [=Profile Annotation=] to the
          local [=Originator Profile Issuer=] to indicate its recognition.

        <h2>Governance Model for Global Community</h2>
        <p>
          The following is a simplified representation of the Originator
          Profile Governance Model planned for Global Community.
        </p>
        <figure id="planned-op-goverance-global">
          <img src="Drawings/Governance-Simplified-OP-Future-Global.drawio.svg"
            alt="Governance Model for Global Community (Planned)" width="90%"/>
          <figcaption>Governance Model for Global Community (Planned)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          In this model, multiple [=Core Profile Issuers=] exist, each responsible
          for issuing [=Core Profiles=] to [=Originators=] and operating under its own
          governance. All [=Core Profile Issuers=] are recognized by "OP Root,"
          which is represented by a special type of [=Originator Profile=], "Core
          OP Root," as shown in the figure. The [=Core Profile Issuers=] may also
          issue other types of [=Profile Annotations=], such as the [=Web Media
          Profile=], based on their governance and policies.
        </p>
        <p>
          By establishing this model, centralization of the governance is
          avoidable, and diversity of the governance is achievable. Governance
          of "OP Root" should be designed to be inclusive, allowing for the
          participation of various stakeholders and the incorporation of
          diverse perspectives &mdash; similar to the multistakeholder
          governance model of [[ICANN]].
        </p>
        <p>
          Establishing and operating such a multistakeholder governance model
          requires careful planning, ongoing collaboration, and a commitment
          to transparency and accountability from all participants. It is
          essential to create a shared understanding of roles,
          responsibilities, and decision-making processes to ensure the
          effective functioning of the governance framework. A lot can be
          learned from the experience of [[ICANN]]. One of the author's
          papers, [[A Study on Governance funded by JFSA]], may provide some
          insights into the challenges and opportunities associated with
          multistakeholder governance models and is helpful for starters who
          are interested in the context.

        <h2>Comparison to C2PA</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity</strong>
          (C2PA)  is a consortium of leading media and technology companies
          collaborating to establish an open standard for content provenance
          and authenticity. The goal of C2PA is to provide a framework for
          creating, sharing, and verifying content authenticity metadata,
          enabling users to trust the content they consume.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project primarily focuses on addressing the challenges of
          content provenance and authenticity in digital media, including
          ensuring the integrity of media files and providing verifiable
          information about their origins. Thus, the scope of C2PA overlaps
          with the [=Originator Profile Framework=] in its goals and
          objectives. Thus we hope to collaborate and align our efforts
          to achieve common objectives.
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, there are some key differences between C2PA and the
          [=Originator Profile Framework=].
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>C2PA focuses on media files</strong>, while [=Originator
          Profile Framework=] primarily aims to provide various content within
          the Web Media, including text, images, and videos. C2PA focuses on
          media files specifically.</li>
          <li><strong>C2PA provides historical data</strong>, while
          [=Originator Profile Framework=] primarily focuses on verification
          by the end-user, rather than the internal work of Web Media. While
          historical data is essential, it appears to be more than sufficient
          for the end-user.
          <br/>
          <blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Some members of OP-CIP have an
          interest in providing content archives, and that naturally may
          include historical information. However, it will be implemented
          differently &mdash; probably, outside of the media data itself.
          </blockquote>
          </li>
          <li><strong>[=Originator Profile Framework=] aims to provide rich
          information about the [=Originator=]</strong> through multiple
          [=Validated Attribute=] providers, accommodating various use cases
          and stakeholder requirements within a flexible framework.</li>
          <li><strong>C2PA's trust model is based on X.509 PKI</strong>, thus
          it shares the same issues we discussed in <a
          href="#limitation-of-digital-certificate-schemes"></a></li>
          <li><strong>C2PA's trust model is centralized</strong>, while there
          is an available trust list for C2PA, such as Adobe's Adobe Approved
          Trust List [[AATL]] and IPTC Origin Verified News Publishers List
          [[IPTC-OVNPL]]. It is a challenge to establish a trust list for
          specific use cases that meets the requirements of any new target
          ecosystem.</li>

        <h2>Terminology Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          When working in standardization, there are always terminology
          challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          We understand that some terms are used differently or may be
          counterintuitive to specific stakeholders. The following terms
          require special attention:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Certificate</li>
          <li>Validate and Verify</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We attempted to be cautious when introducing concepts in <a
          href="#architecture"></a>, and provided additional notes. Please
          provide feedback not only on these terms but also on the overall
          document.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, note that some inconsistencies still exist in the terminology
          used within the currently available documents. The [[Originator
          Profile Blueprints]] are mostly consistent within the document
          series, but some of the terminology is used slightly differently
          from this Architectural Overview document. We will address these
          inconsistencies while incorporating the [[Originator Profile
          Blueprints]] into the [=Originator Profile Framework=] documentation
          series.

        <h2>Internationalization and Multilingual Support</h2>
        <p>
          There are some internationalization and multilingual challenges in
          the use of [[vc-data-model-2.0]]. The current version of the data
          model suggests using a single language for each of the signed data
          objects. This decision is due to the fact that the current
          JSON-LD-based multilingual structure is complex to decode on the
          verifier side, which, in our case, is within a browser. The cost is
          not negligible; thus, we currently apply one language to the
          entire [=Profile Annotation=] model, which potentially contains
          multilingual strings. While it is possible to provide multiple PAs
          of the same type with different languages, the current extension
          does not yet support this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also note that, while the contents of the Web Media use case usually
          do not require extensive multilingual support since the contents are
          typically in one language per page, the information within the
          [=Originator Profile=] requires multilingual support regardless of
          the contents.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other challenge is selecting the languages to be included. For
          Japanese, inclusion of both Japanese and English is necessary, but
          it is not clear for other languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are exploring various options to address this issue and may
          propose a different scheme that is more suitable for our use case.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="issue-key-rollover">
        <h2>Key delivery and discovery</h2>
        <p>
          The current version of the data model directly embeds a verification
          key in the format of JWKS [[RFC7517]]. Effectively, the current
          model does not allow key rollover. Also, there is no key discovery
          mechanism yet, since keys are usually not difficult to retrieve for
          the Web Media use cases. At the same time, we assume the website is
          operated by the [=Originator=] itself, and is reliable enough.
          </p>
        <p>
          Without a doubt, this is not always the case. Especially, if we
          extend the use of the [=Originator Profile Framework=] to other use
          cases, including the Web Advertisement, we need to have a better
          mechanism.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are designing a key discovery and rollover scheme using DNS/DNSSEC.
          DNSSEC provides benefits, including but not limited to the following:
          <ol>
            <li>Allowing multiple keys for an identifier (such as DNS, Full
            Qualified Domain Name &mdash; FQDN) to coexist, with each key
            having different parameters, including validity period and
            algorithm selection.</li>
            <li>Multiple signatures can be associated with a set of resource
            records, each of which can be linked to one of the currently
            published keys alongside its corresponding signature. This scheme
            allows for the simultaneous publication of both old keys and new
            keys for a specified period, facilitating a smooth key
            rollover.</li>
            <li>Revoking a key is possible by just removing expired resource
            records.</li>
          </ol>
          These benefits also allow us to provide a reliable key discovery
          mechanism. Also, since DNS is highly scalable, it can accommodate a
          large number of keys without significant overhead.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the current design of the [=Originator Profile Framework=]
          scheme does not rely on X.509[[X509V3]]-based certificates, it is
          possible to embed an X.509 certificate within the [=Core Profile=],
          then annotate it with multiple [=Profile Annotations=].
          Unfortunately, if an X.509 certificate is used, it not only
          complicates the key rollover process, but also misses the benefits
          of DNSSEC, especially the low-overhead revocation. Note that the
          latest trend in operating X.509 certificates to address revocation
          checks is reducing the validity period, which is not ideal for our
          use case.

        <h2>Profile Delivery/Retrieval</h2>
        <p>
          Currently, [=Originator Profile=] consists of [=Core Profile=],
          [=Profile Annotation=], [=Web Media Profile=], [=Website Profile=],
          and the [=Originator Profile=] is delivered via a well-known URL of
          the website. Each component of the [=Originator Profile=] may be
          distributed via different channels, then combined to be used at the
          [=Recipient=] side.
        </p>
        <p>
          [=Core Profile=] is designed to be compact and deliverable via
          DNS, which relates to the aforementioned key rollover design.
          [=Profile Annotations=] may be delivered via different channels.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Extension of Profile Annotation</h2>
        <p>
          One of the key features of the [=Originator Profile Framework=] is
          its extensibility, which is achieved through the use of [=Profile
          Annotations=]. Each [=Profile Annotation=] can be defined to
          accommodate specific use cases and requirements, allowing for a
          flexible and adaptable framework. The following are some potential
          uses of the [=Profile Annotation=].
        </p>
        <section>
          <h3>Profile Annotation Issuer Recognition</h3>
          <p>
            A kind of membership annotation is an example of [=Profile
            Annotation=] extensibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            Interestingly, the existence of a [=Profile Annotation=] issued by
            the specific [=Profile Annotation Issuer=] itself, without
            additional [=Validated Attributes=] under the [=Profile Annotation
            Policy=], is useful enough to show the [=Profile Annotation
            Issuer=]'s intent. For example, if a media association issues a
            membership [=Profile Annotation=] to a media company, the
            existence of the membership [=Profile Annotation=] itself is
            sufficient to indicate that the media company is a member of the
            association, even if the [=Profile Annotation=] does not include
            additional [=Validated Attributes=].
          </p>
          <p>
            This approach allows for a lightweight and efficient way to
            recognize the affiliation or membership of an [=Originator=]
            without the need for extensive data within the [=Profile
            Annotation=].
          </p>
          <p>
            This concept can be applied to various use cases that require
            creating a kind of list of [=Originators=] who meet specific
            criteria, without creating and managing a list as a database.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Vocabularies and Profile Annotations</h3>
          <p>
            Vocabularies will play a crucial role in defining the semantics of
            [=Profile Annotations=]. They provide a standardized way to
            represent and communicate specific concepts, making it easier for
            different systems to understand and process the information
            contained within a [=Profile Annotation=]. By leveraging existing
            vocabularies or creating new ones, we can enhance the
            expressiveness and interoperability of [=Profile Annotations=].
          </p>
          <p>
            Multiple existing vocabularies and schemas exist and can be
            utilized for [=Profile Annotations=]. These vocabularies provide a
            rich set of terms and definitions that can be used to describe
            various aspects of an [=Originator=] or its attributes.

      <h1>Use Cases</h1>
      <p>
        In this section, we introduce some of the use cases we are currently
        trying to address. A list of requirements for that use case follows
        each use case narrative. This section loosely follows <a
        href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/">W3C’s Verifiable
        Credentials Use Cases</a> style.
      </p>
      <p>
        The use cases are divided into three categories: Web Media Use Cases,
        Local Government Use Cases, and Web Service Site Use Cases.
      </p>
      
      <section>
        <h2>Web Media Use Cases</h2>
        <p>
          The Web Media Use Cases focus on scenarios where users accessing

          <h3>Paul: A user who reads news articles on a media site</h3>
          <p>
            Paul is an avid reader of news articles, usually reading articles from
            his favorite newspapers on their websites. Newspaper websites are
            curated as a whole, not just individual articles, making it easy to
            access articles Paul wants to read at any given time. If the site
            utilizes OP, it is easy to confirm that Paul is accessing the correct
            site he always visits, reducing the risk of accidentally connecting to
            fake sites, which is appreciated. Recently, a change in the editorial
            policy of a broadcasting company was announced. Paul noticed this and
            wanted to check the editorial policy of the newspaper company in
            question. Still, OP allows him to easily and reliably access
            information about the newspaper company's code of conduct. Media
            operational guidelines provided through OP are available through the
            same interface regardless of the site, making it easy to access the
            information and contact the relevant parties if necessary.

          <p>
            Nancy is a user who wants to spend as little time as possible using a
            computer. She thinks it is enough to get the bare minimum of news, so
            she mainly skims through news articles provided on the portal site she
            is familiar with. Today, she stumbled upon an article on the portal
            site that caught her attention, but she was skeptical because it
            seemed too well-written, so she wanted to know where the article came
            from. The article had an OP attached, so the source of the article was
            clear. Furthermore, since the article was a summary, she visited the
            source site to read the full text. Since the summary includes the link
            to the original article, which is secured via OP framework, she can
            safely click and follow the link to access the article. She can
            confirm the relationship between the original article and the summary,
            who is responsible for the summary, and whether the original article
            includes a link that has been altered without permission.

          <h3>John: A user who receives the latest news from social networks</h3>
          <p>
            John is an internet user who makes active use of social networks.
            He subscribes to online newspapers and occasionally visits their
            websites, but he primarily relies on news from social networks
            because it’s easy. Some of the articles shared on social networks
            catch his interest, and he occasionally clicks on them to learn
            more. However, he often finds that the headlines and photos on
            social networks that entice clicks do not match the actual
            articles, which has caused him frustration on multiple occasions.
            Additionally, there is a possibility that the linked articles may
            be related to criminal content, leading him to feel a strong sense
            of risk. If the relationship between the headlines on social
            networks and the actual articles were more reliable, it is
            anticipated that concerns about risks could be reduced, thereby
            minimizing specific issues

          <h3>Robert: A PC expert who visits news websites directly</h3>
          <p>
            Robert is a highly skilled PC expert who has been using the
            internet since before search engines were introduced. He finds it
            more comfortable to operate the computer using only the keyboard
            rather than relying on the mouse. When browsing websites, he
            directly inputs the URL into the URL bar to specify the site he
            wants to visit. Since he frequently visits most sites, the browser
            automatically completes the URL, allowing him to reach the desired
            website. However, he occasionally makes mistakes when typing.
            Criminals sometimes use website names that resemble well-known
            sites but are prone to typos. One day, Robert accidentally visited
            such a site. Fortunately, Robert had installed OP's web extension
            in his browser, so he noticed that the site did not have OP
            attached. Since the websites Robert usually uses have OP, he
            noticed the anomaly and avoided any issues.

            find any valid attested OP on it. Then she returned to the ad
            image and found that there was no valid OP either. Emma knew that
            Z Securities usually advertises on TV and the Internet, and it
            uses OP on its website. As a result, she identified that both the
            ad and the website were fraudulent imitations of Z Securities, and

            post on social media from a well-known media outlet. It included a
            link to a video of a candidate's speech. He thought there was a
            problem with the content of the speech and considered sharing the
            post to inform more people about it. Before doing so, he checked
            the OP. The official website of the media outlet usually has a
            valid OP, but the linked site, which appeared to be the media
            outlet's website, did not. Ichiro quickly identified the website
            as mimicking and avoided spreading potentially deceptive content.

        <section>
          <h3>Ken: A public relations officer at a local government office on the day of a major earthquake</h3>
          <p>
            A major earthquake hit the village where Ken works.
            Immediately after the quake, videos began to be spread on social
            media claiming that a tsunami had struck the village. But these
            videos were actually taken in a different location on a different
            day. And in reality, no tsunami had hit Ken's village.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, the office received numerous inquiries from people
            who had seen the social media posts about the tsunami. A claim such
            as "Social media reports that a tsunami has struck location A and
            residents are stranded. Please dispatch a rescue team" causes
            disruptions to many kinds of operations during the time of
            emergency.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ken posted the following message on the office's website: "If you
            see footage of a disaster in the village on social media, first
            check the OP of the content. If there is an OP, it means that the
            information was posted responsibly by the originator." As a
            result, the confusion gradually subsided.
